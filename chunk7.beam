TITLE NP-Hardness Preservation

OBJECT SAT_instance
OBJECT L_instance = L_mix^hash

BEAM REDUCE:
  SAT -> block-CNF Φ
  compatibility graph H
  clique size t

BEAM HASH:
  apply VV hashing
  isolate unique witness with prob >= 1/poly

PROPERTY:
  SAT(F)=1 iff L_mix^hash(H,Φ,S)=1

BEAM AUDIT_COMPAT:
  WV, FOCUS, BRC, SRC, SPA
  do not alter satisfiability semantics

CONCLUDE:
  NP-hardness preserved under audits
