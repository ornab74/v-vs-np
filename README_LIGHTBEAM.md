# LightBeam Files (ASC Chunks 1–3)
Generated: 2025-12-24

These `.beam` files are a symbolic “constraint-flow” representation of the Audit Soundness Conjecture (ASC) proof attempt.

- `asc_chunk_01.beam` — audit game + suite definition (WV/FOCUS/BRC/SRC/SPA)
- `asc_chunk_02.beam` — amplification logic closing the resampling quantifier loophole
- `asc_chunk_03.beam` — formal hinge lemma blueprint with explicit repetition/union-bound structure

Workflow:
1. Read chunk 01 for the *model spec*.
2. Read chunk 02 for the *attack logic* and threat model.
3. Read chunk 03 for the *publishable hinge lemma* to complete ASC under the strengthened suite.

Next recommended chunk:
- CHUNK 4: Full English formal proof of AMP-CONDITION with explicit probabilities and quantifiers.
