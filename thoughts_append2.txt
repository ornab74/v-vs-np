Chunk 7 — Explicit Tseitin family + restriction invariants (proof/circuit hybrid)
Objective: Build an explicit UNSAT CNF family T(G, b) whose hardness survives random restrictions and is robust under many proof systems.

7.1 Tseitin setup
- Let G=(V,E) be a bounded-degree expander.
- Variables: x_e ∈ {0,1} for each edge e∈E.
- For each vertex v, constraint: ⊕_{e incident to v} x_e = b_v (mod 2).
- Choose b with odd parity (⊕_v b_v = 1). Then the system is inconsistent ⇒ UNSAT.

7.2 CNF encoding
- Encode each parity constraint of small arity (degree d) into CNF with 2^{d-1} clauses (or use extension vars for linear-size).
- Resulting CNF size is poly(|E|).

7.3 Restriction invariants
Under random restriction ρ that fixes a constant fraction of edge variables:
- The remaining constraints induce a Tseitin instance on a subgraph G' that (with good probability) still contains a large expander minor / large connected component.
- If enough structure remains (e.g., large 2-core), the residual formula remains UNSAT with “distributed” inconsistency.

7.4 Known hardness lever (weak systems)
- Resolution width lower bounds for Tseitin on expanders are large ⇒ exponential resolution size.
- Random restrictions can be used to show bounded-depth proof systems cannot efficiently refute the family (when suitably encoded).

Deliverable of Chunk 7: a family where (A) UNSAT is explicit; (B) restrictions preserve a hard core; (C) lower bounds in some proof systems are provable.

Chunk 8 — Bounded-depth Frege collapse under restrictions (A+C fusion)
Objective: emulate the switching-lemma effect for bounded-depth Frege (AC^0-Frege), i.e., show proofs simplify significantly under random restrictions while Tseitin/PHP cores persist.

8.1 Target statement template
For proof system P = depth-d Frege:
- For a random restriction ρ~R_p, with high probability, any purported short P-proof π of F becomes a proof π|_ρ of F|_ρ with “simpler” structure.
- Then argue that F|_ρ still requires large resources (width/degree/communication), giving contradiction.

8.2 Proof simplification mechanism
- Restrictions turn many formulas appearing in the proof into constants or low decision-tree depth formulas.
- Apply a structural lemma: depth-d formulas under R_p become depth-(d-1) or become small decision trees, with high probability (analogous to circuit switching).
- Use this to bound the variety/complexity of derived lines in the restricted proof.

8.3 Hard-core persistence for Tseitin
- Choose p so that the restricted graph G' still contains an expander-like substructure of size ≈ n^α.
- Show Tseitin(G',b') retains a lower bound measure M(F|_ρ) that any restricted proof must pay.

Deliverable of Chunk 8: a “collapse lemma for proofs” + “invariant measure for formula” that yields exponential lower bounds for bounded-depth Frege on explicit tautologies.

Chunk 9 — Interpolation + lifting: translate proof lower bounds into circuit lower bounds (C→B bridge)
Objective: use interpolation to move from proof lower bounds to monotone/nonuniform circuit lower bounds, then attempt lifting to broader classes.

9.1 Interpolation pipeline
- Construct unsat formulas A(X,Y) ∧ B(X,Y) with graph-structure split, as in Clique∧Coloring or Tseitin-style splits.
- If system P admits feasible interpolation, short P-proofs ⇒ small (often monotone) circuits for an associated separation task.

9.2 Concrete outcome
If we can show: “P-proofs of F_{n,k,t} are superpolynomial,” then contrapositive says: “small monotone circuits for CLIQUE would follow from short proofs,” contradicting monotone lower bounds.

9.3 Attempted lift toward SAT
- SAT is not monotone; direct monotone interpolation doesn’t target SAT.
- Strategy: reduce SAT to a separation problem with monotonicity in a structured input encoding (e.g., monotone property of constraint graphs / gadgets).
- Key difficulty: keeping the translation size-preserving and avoiding natural-proofs barriers.

Deliverable of Chunk 9: a precise map of which proof systems yield which circuit classes via interpolation, and where monotonicity is gained/lost.

Chunk 10 — Replace “labeling H_n” with “certificate-checking H_n”: proof-guided identification sets
Objective: salvage Route B by avoiding SAT labeling of a test set, using proof objects as verifiable surrogates.

10.1 Redefine identification target
Instead of needing SAT(x) labels for x∈H_n, require that for each x in H_n, the candidate circuit C(x) is accompanied by a *checkable certificate*:
- If C(x)=1 (sat), provide a satisfying assignment w, verified in poly time.
- If C(x)=0 (unsat), provide a refutation π in a fixed proof system P, verified in poly time.

So the test becomes:
Check V_sat(x,w)=1 when C(x)=1; check V_unsat(x,π)=1 when C(x)=0.

10.2 Why this helps and where it breaks
- Helps: avoids needing us to solve SAT to label H_n; the circuit supplies witnesses.
- Breaks: UNSAT certificates exist only if P is complete and refutations are short. For general unsat formulas, short refutations may not exist.

10.3 New keystone lemma
Find a proof system P such that:
(i) P refutations are *always* polynomial for the instances in H_n that are unsat;
(ii) yet P is weak enough that proving lower bounds is possible;
(iii) H_n is explicit and small.

This becomes a controlled “promise SAT” setting.

Deliverable of Chunk 10: a concrete definition of proof-assisted hitting sets and a roadmap of what properties they must satisfy.

Chunk 11 — A concrete promise problem target that might bypass barriers: Gap-SAT with local checkability
Objective: shift from SAT to a promise version where NO instances have short, locally checkable refutations.

11.1 Use PCP/gap amplification
Construct instances φ' such that:
- YES: φ' satisfiable.
- NO: every assignment violates ≥ ε fraction of constraints.

11.2 Local unsat certificates
For some constraint systems (e.g., expander-based CSPs), unsatisfiability can be witnessed by small “inconsistency cores” or spectral/linear-algebra certificates.
Seek a class where NO certificates are short and efficiently verifiable.

11.3 Why this is relevant
If you can prove that solving this promise problem is NP-hard *and* has short NO-certificates, then you can plug it into Chunk 10’s proof-assisted H_n without needing heavy proof systems.

Deliverable of Chunk 11: identify a candidate promise-CSP family and formalize its YES/NO certificates.

Chunk 12 — The proposed endgame stitch (still a conjectural leap)
Objective: combine (A) restricted-model collapse; (C) interpolation; (B) proof-assisted hitting sets; (PCP) local certification, into a single separation.

12.1 Endgame equation candidates
E1: Build an explicit family of instances I_n of a promise NP-complete problem such that:
- Any poly-size circuit deciding I_n would yield a poly-size family of verifiable certificates on a small explicit set H_n that forces global correctness (identification).
- But any such identification implies a non-natural property strong enough to contradict pseudorandomness assumptions derived from the same hardness (a “self-defeating” loop), forcing the conclusion that the assumed poly circuits cannot exist.

12.2 What’s missing (single keystone)
A keystone lifting lemma that turns:
- “restricted collapse + local certification”
into
- “global circuit lower bound for SAT / NP”.

The best articulation of the missing piece:
K: a uniform, size-preserving way to *amplify* lower bounds from a structured promise family (with local NO certificates) to unrestricted SAT without introducing naturalness/relativization vulnerabilities.

=== End continuation ===

7.2 Why Tseitin is hard in restricted models
- For resolution: width lower bounds on Tseitin over expanders imply exponential size via size≥2^{Ω(width)}.
- For bounded-depth Frege / AC^0-Frege: random restrictions + switching-style arguments preserve a core unsatisfied parity structure while collapsing bounded-depth reasoning.
- For bounded-degree expanders, the constraints are locally small but globally inconsistent—good for restriction robustness.

7.3 Restriction invariant (key): Expansion preserves unsatisfied parity core
Let ρ be a restriction that fixes a (1-p) fraction of edges. The remaining subgraph G' induced by free edges typically retains an expander-like component of size Ω(p|E|) for suitable p. The induced Tseitin instance on that component remains unsatisfiable when the parity of b restricted to the component is odd.
Target lemma: With non-negligible probability over ρ, there exists a large connected component C in G' such that ⊕_{v∈C} b_v = 1, hence Tseitin(C,b|_C) is UNSAT.

7.4 Outcome of Chunk 7
We obtain an explicit UNSAT family with:
(A) Strong known lower bounds in resolution.
(B) A natural playground for restriction-based proof collapse in bounded-depth Frege.

Chunk 8 — Proof-collapse for bounded-depth Frege (A+C fusion)
Objective: Show that under a suitable random restriction ρ, any bounded-depth Frege proof Π of Tseitin collapses into a shallow decision-tree-like object, while the restricted Tseitin formula remains hard, yielding a contradiction unless Π is huge.

8.1 Modeling bounded-depth Frege
A depth-d Frege proof can be viewed as manipulating bounded-depth formulas via inference rules. Under restrictions, bounded-depth formulas simplify; switching lemma analogs apply to each formula in the proof.

8.2 Switching lemma for proof lines (schematic)
For a DNF/CNF line L of width w, under ρ~R_p:
Pr[ DTdepth(L|_ρ) ≥ t ] ≤ (c p w)^t.
Extend by union bound over all lines in Π. If |Π| is small, choose parameters so all lines collapse simultaneously with high probability.

8.3 Preservation of Tseitin hardness under ρ
By Chunk 7's invariant, with noticeable probability the restricted instance still contains a large unsatisfiable core requiring large width (resolution) or requiring depth/size blowup for bounded-depth Frege.
Thus Π|_ρ cannot refute the restricted instance if Π was too small—contradiction.

8.4 Outcome of Chunk 8
Exponential lower bounds for bounded-depth Frege refutations of Tseitin (in the regimes where the above can be made formal).

Chunk 9 — From proof lower bounds to circuit lower bounds: interpolation with monotonicity
Objective: Translate a hypothetical short proof of a carefully designed contradiction into a small circuit for an explicit hard function, then contradict known circuit lower bounds.

9.1 Use the Clique-vs-Coloring CNF family F_{n,k,t}(G)
As earlier: UNSAT for t>k. Split variables into graph bits X and witness bits Y.

9.2 Interpolant I(X)
From a short proof in an interpolating proof system, extract I(X) that separates:
YES: graphs with t-clique => I=1
NO: k-colorable graphs => I=0
I can be monotone in edge variables.

9.3 Known monotone lower bound
Monotone circuit size for CLIQUE_{n,t} is exp(Ω(n^ε)) for appropriate t(n). Therefore any proof that yields a poly-size monotone interpolant must be superpolynomial.

9.4 Outcome of Chunk 9
A completed cross-world theorem: short proofs would imply small monotone circuits; since monotone circuits are large, proofs must be large.

Chunk 10 — Attempt to lift from monotone hardness to general circuits (where the wall is)
Objective: Convert an unconditional monotone lower bound into a lower bound for general circuits, or into SAT hardness.

10.1 Why monotone is too weak
General circuits can use negations and cancellations; monotone lower bounds do not directly transfer.

10.2 Lifting attempt via monotone projections / gadget composition
Define gadget G_m that replaces each edge variable x with a structured subfunction g(x, y) such that:
- any small general circuit for the composed function would induce a small monotone circuit for the original.
This is the 'monotone-to-general lifting' keystone.

10.3 Keystone Lemma (missing)
Find a gadget family with a proven 'monotone extraction' property:
If C computes f∘gadget with size poly, then there exists a monotone circuit C' of size poly' computing f.
This is not known for general f like CLIQUE with strong parameters.

10.4 Outcome of Chunk 10
We isolate a concrete missing lemma: a monotone-extracting lifting theorem strong enough to upgrade known monotone lower bounds into general circuit lower bounds.

Chunk 11 — A different lift: proof complexity to circuit complexity via feasible interpolation beyond monotone
Objective: Use stronger interpolation (not necessarily monotone) to produce circuits in a class where we have lower bounds.

11.1 Replace monotone target with a function hard for a non-monotone restricted class
Example: AC^0[p], low-degree polynomial threshold, read-once branching programs, etc.

11.2 Design a contradiction whose interpolant must lie in that restricted class if proofs are short
Then apply known lower bounds in that class.

11.3 Outcome of Chunk 11
Potentially stronger-than-monotone conclusions, but requires very careful proof-system choice and encoding.

Chunk 12 — Return to SAT: search-to-decision + certification without labeling
Objective: Revive the Route B 'identification set' idea without needing SAT labels.

12.1 Replace labels with certificates
Instead of requiring SAT(x) for x in H_n, require that the circuit's outputs can be locally certified via:
- self-reduction tree consistency
- and a succinct proof (e.g., resolution or Frege) for the NO branches.

12.2 Consistency equations
For formula φ and variable x:
C(φ) = C(φ[x=0]) ∨ C(φ[x=1]).
If C(φ)=0, require a short refutation certificate for φ.
If C(φ)=1, require a short witness assignment plus verification.

12.3 Keystone Lemma (missing)
Show that any poly-size circuit family C for SAT can be forced—by checking only poly-many local consistency constraints plus poly-many certificates—to be globally correct.
This is a 'local-to-global' theorem for SAT correctness; it would imply SAT∉P/poly if contradicted by diagonalization.

12.4 Outcome of Chunk 12
A concrete path that avoids direct SAT labeling, but depends on a strong local-to-global soundness theorem for circuit correctness.

Chunk 13 — Candidate new principle: non-natural lower bounds via incompressible refutations
Objective: Bypass 'natural proofs' by using a property that is not large (thus not natural), but still checkable on structured families.

13.1 Define property P_n of functions f:{0,1}^n→{0,1}
P_n(f)=1 if there exists a short (poly(n)) proof in a fixed proof system that f differs from every size-n^k circuit on at least one input.
This property is not large (very few random f have such short metaproofs), so it avoids naturalness.

13.2 Checkability
We can check P_n(f) given the metaproof. Construct explicit f in NP where such metaproofs are impossible if SAT had small circuits, aiming for contradiction.

13.3 Keystone Lemma (missing)
Connect 'metaproofs about circuit disagreement' to actual circuit lower bounds without importing pseudorandomness assumptions.

13.4 Outcome of Chunk 13
A speculative bypass route: shift from proving lower bounds directly to proving impossibility of succinct meta-certificates.

Chunk 14 — Endgame synthesis: what would constitute a full P≠NP proof in this ladder
Any one of these keystones suffices:
K1: SAT∉P/poly (direct circuit LB).
K2: A monotone-extracting lifting theorem that upgrades known monotone CLIQUE LBs to general circuits.
K3: A local-to-global theorem for SAT-circuit correctness using only poly many consistency checks + certificates.
K4: Superpoly lower bounds for Extended Frege (implying no poly-bounded proof system, reinforcing hardness structure).

The ladder above completes strong results in restricted worlds (AC^0 circuits, resolution/bounded-depth Frege proofs) and pinpoints the precise bridge lemmas required to reach general circuits / SAT.
